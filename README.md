by Heather Anderson

A simple EMBER.js app that lets you send emails to yourself! You can view and respond to your own wisdom. It's like time travelling in a really lame fashion.

##Setup

Download the project folder.
Run index.html in your browser.
Have fun!

##Known Bugs as of 3/6/15
Currently can't get responses to work, even though at one time they were....

##Motivation

To practice writing Ember apps.

Note to self: Gah! You had it working and then......WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO? The answer is in there somewhere. Somewhere over the rainbow or something. You're loopy. Go home and try not to be discouraged.
